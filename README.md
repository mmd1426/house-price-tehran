# House-Price-Tehran

## Introduction

This project is designed to predict housing prices in Tehran based on real estate transaction data. It utilizes machine learning techniques for analysis and prediction, helping users evaluate and analyze the housing market.
The project uses a dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mokar2001/house-price-tehran-iran).

## Features

* **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implementation of a Random Forest model for housing price prediction.
* **Feature Analysis**: Examination and analysis of key features like area (square meters), number of rooms, geographical location, and construction year.
* **High Accuracy**: The models are trained to provide precise price estimates based on input data.

## Models

* A Random Forest model has been used to predict housing prices based on the dataset.
* The models are trained using data available on Kaggle, with evaluation metrics such as MAE and RMSE to measure prediction accuracy.

## Future Improvements

* Adding new data to enhance prediction accuracy.
* Optimizing models for faster and more precise execution.
